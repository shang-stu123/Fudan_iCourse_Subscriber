"""Unified PPT fetch → dHash dedup → OCR → classify pipeline.

Two consumption patterns share the same four stages:

  PPTPipeline.submit(...)          → returns a ``PPTAsyncHandle`` that holds
                                     in-flight OCR ``Future`` s.  Caller (the
                                     LectureRunner) does ASR transcription in
                                     parallel, then calls ``handle.drain()`` to
                                     block for stats.  With ``defer_ocr=True``
                                     the OCR jobs are submitted by ``drain``
                                     itself, so ASR keeps the CPU to itself.
  PPTPipeline.prefetch_and_ocr(...) → same stages for the *next* lecture,
                                     kicked off while the current lecture
                                     waits on the LLM.  The next ``submit``
                                     call absorbs whatever it finished.

The four stages are identical in both paths (``_collect_survivors``):

  1. Fetch the PPT list from iCourse and ``INSERT OR IGNORE`` each row into
     ``ppt_pages`` with ``ocr_status='pending'``.  Idempotent — safe to call
     across resumed runs.  Items typically come from the prefetch cache the
     previous lecture warmed up; if absent, ``submit`` re-schedules.
  2. Collect image bytes for every still-pending page.  Pulls from
     ``Scheduler.image_cache`` (prefetch) first, then falls back to a sync
     ``fetch_ppt_image`` call for any pending row missing from the cache
     (typically a stale row from a prior interrupted run, or a download
     that failed in the prefetch pool).  Pages whose row is already
     done/invalid/failed/dedup_dropped are never re-collected, so their
     status can't be overwritten by a later pass.
  3. dHash dedup over the chronologically ordered pending pages — garbage-
     catalog matches and pairwise near-duplicates are stamped
     ``dedup_dropped`` and removed before OCR.
  4. For each survivor: submit an OCR job to ``Scheduler.submit_ocr`` (live
     concurrency is capped by a fixed BoundedSemaphore).  Workers classify
     the OCR'd text as ``invalid`` (matches one of the classroom-noise
     screens) or ``done``, and write the row in place.

``get_done_ppt_pages`` only surfaces rows with status='done', so dropped /
invalid / failed pages naturally drop out of the LLM prompt.
